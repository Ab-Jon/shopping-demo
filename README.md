# shopping_demo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple shopping app showing a list of products and the functionality of adding it to the cart or check out screen.
Sincere apologies that the files uploaded are scattered, i had to upload the manually. This is as a result of the error i encountered while trying to share this project to Github through Android studio.

The project consists of the main.dart screen, home.dart, product.dart screen and checkout,dart screen.
The main.dart is where the bottom nav bar conisting of the product screen and the checkout screen is placed.
The product.dart consists of a list of products arranged in a list view form.
The checkout screen is initially empty. The items that populate the screen are items that are added from the product screen. It has an elevated button. When the button is clicked, it clears all the items in the checkout screen.
